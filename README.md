# Loose Cell-Attached Patch Clamp Recording Amplifier

## Description

This device is for recording electrical spiking responses from brain cells. It is a variation on commonly-used patch clamp amplifiers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_clamp) but specialized to allow relatively high voltages (100s of mV) to be applied to neurons through low-resistance seals. Using this device, brief depolarizing stimulus pulses can trigger action potentials in neurons which can be recorded through the same amplifier.

The construction and operation of this circuit is described in the following article:

The **PCB files** folder contains files needed to have the headstage amplifier circuit printed circuit board manufactured. These files were generated by the DipTrace program and prototype boards were manufactured by Bay Area Circuits (https://bayareacircuits.com).
